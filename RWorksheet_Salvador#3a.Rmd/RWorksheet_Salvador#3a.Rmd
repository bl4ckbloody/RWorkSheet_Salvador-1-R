## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1 There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet
#and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
UppercaseLetters<- LETTERS [1:26]
UppercaseLetters

Lowercaseletters<- letters [1:26]
Lowercaseletters

#Based on the above vector LETTERS:
#a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
First_11 <- LETTERS [1:11]
First_11

#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
odd_Numbers <- LETTERS[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
odd_Numbers

#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
vowel_letters <- letters [c(1, 5, 9, 15, 21)]
vowel_letters

#Based on the above vector letters:
#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
Lowercaseletters <- letters [22:26]
Lowercaseletters

#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.
vector_letters <- letters [c(15:24)]
vector_letters

#2. Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average
#temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

CityandAveTemp_vector <- c("Tuguegarao City" = 42,"Manila" = 39,"Iloilo City" = 34,"Tacloban" = 34,"Samal Island = 30","Davao City" = 27)
city_vector

#a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town
#of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the
#object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.
city_vector <- c("Tuguegarao City","Manila","Iloilo City","Tacloban","Samal Island","Davao City")
city_vector

#Output
#[1] "Tuguegarao City" "Manila"          "Iloilo City"     "Tacloban"        "Samal Island"   
#[6] "Davao City" 

#b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.
#Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow
#what is in the instruction.

tempCel <- c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
tempCel

#Output
#[1] 42 39 34 34 30 27


#c. Create a dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using ‘data.frame(). What
#the R code and its result?
df <- data.frame(city_vector = city_vector, tempCel = tempCel)

View(df)

#4 Tacloban              34
#5 Samal Island          30
#6 Davao City            27

#d. Associate the dataframe you have created in 2.(c) by naming the columns using
#the names() function. Change the column names by using names() function as City and
#Temperature. What is the R code and its result?
names(df) <- c("City", "Temperature")

#Output
#    City             Temperature
#1 Tuguegarao City       42

#5 Samal Island          30
#6 Davao City            27

#e Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
str(df)

#The str() function tells us how many rows and columns are in the dataframe and what kinds of data each column contains

#From the answer in d, what is the content of row 3 and row 4 What is its R code and
#its output?
rows3_4 <- df[3:4, ]
rows3_4

#Output
#> rows3_4 <- df[3:4, ]
#> rows3_4
#        City Temperature
#3 Iloilo City          34
#4    Tacloban          34

#g. From the answer in d, display the city with highest temperature and the city with
#the lowest temperature. What is its R code and its output?

hightempcity <- df[df$Temperature == max(df$Temperature), ]
hightempcity

lowtempcity <-df[df$Temperature == min(df$Temperature), ]
lowtempcity

#Output
#> hightempcity <- df[df$Temperature == max(df$Temperature), ]
#> hightempcity
#             City Temperature
#1 Tuguegarao City          42
#> 
#> lowtempcity <-df[df$Temperature == min(df$Temperature), ]
#> lowtempcity
